# README-Generator
                    
## Description
I made this read me generator to test my skills and knowledge of node.js. In addition, it also gave me a tool to create readme files for this and futurue projects. I practiced using node.js, writing files using a node standard library, calling apis and destructing objects.

When there, type git clone and then paste the link and the clone should copy to your local machine. Afterwards, type "npm install axios inquirer@8.2.4" to install the required nodes to run this code.
